TODO for hugin:
---------------

  * Look for items under src/foreign and see whether such packages exist
    in Debian already.
  * Double check cmake's support for CFLAGS/LDFLAGS.
  * Track down embedded code copies and get rid of them (at least don't
    use them). Notify the security team about them. At the moment,
    there's vigra_impex at least (see libvigraimpex-dev).
  * Find nice short descriptions for each package.
  * Also mention tca_correct; make sure all binaries are listed there.
  * Adapt README.Debian, probably specifying that this version and later
    are OK-ish, or even drop it.
